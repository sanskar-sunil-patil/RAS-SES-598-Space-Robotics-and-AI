# Terrain Mapping Drone Control

This ROS2 package implements a drone control system for terrain mapping of the Bishop Fault Scarp using ORBSLAM3 and PX4 SITL simulation.

# 1. Abstract =

This report presents the development and implementation of a ROS2-based drone control system for terrain mapping of the Bishop Fault Scarp. The system utilizes PX4 SITL for simulation and ORBSLAM3 for real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). A structured lawnmower pattern is employed to ensure full area coverage while maintaining a consistent altitude. The system is capable of autonomous takeoff, flight control, data acquisition, and return to the launch point. This document details the system's architecture, methodology, implementation, results, and potential improvements.

* Integrate PX4 SITL for simulation and ORBSLAM3 for real-time mapping.

* Implement a lawnmower flight pattern for complete area coverage.

* Enable configurable flight parameters for flexible survey planning.

* Provide data outputs in forms of 3D point clouds, trajectory logs, and images.


# 3. System Architecture =

## 3.1 High-Level Overview =

The system consists of the following components:

* PX4 SITL Simulator: Simulates UAV dynamics.

* ROS2-based Controller: Manages drone navigation and data acquisition.
